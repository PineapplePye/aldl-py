# --- General syntax information ---
#
# Lines with a hash symbol as the first non-whitespace character are comments.
# Comments and blank lines (including lines with only whitespace) are ignored.
#
# All values in this file are either integers or strings. If more than one
# appear on the same line, they must be separated by whitespaces.
#
# Integers (including bytes of data) can be written in decimal, hexadecimal, or
# octal in the regular C-style format. For example, "123" for decimal, "0x7b"
# for hex, or 0173 for octal.
#
# Strings must be enclosed in quotation marks if they contain spaces or are
# empty. Otherwise, quotes are optional. Note that double quotes must be used,
# not single. Double quotes cannot be part of a string.

# --- Data Stream Definition starts here ---

# The first line identifies this as an 8192 baud data stream and defines the
# message ID this stream uses.
8192 0xf4

# The next line defines the command to put the ECM back in normal mode. It
# must contain the mode number followed by any additional bytes to go into
# the ALDL request message. This line probably won't have to change, since
# normal mode is pretty universally mode 0 with an empty message.
0x00

# Lastly, one or more transmit mode blocks. Each of these blocks defines one
# of the ECM's transmit modes and the data to expect back after it is put in
# that mode.
#
# Each transmit mode block contains a two line header followed by the data
# descriptions.

# --- Transmit block starts here ---

# The first line of the header describes the command to switch to this transmit
# mode. It must contain the mode number, followed by any additional bytes to go
# into the ALDL request message.
0x01 0x00

# The other line of the header contains the number of data bytes to expect back
# in the response from the ECM.
63

# The rest of the block contains the data descriptions. This is actually what
# makes up the bulk of this file.

# Here is the format:
#
# Each byte has its own line. First, a string for the name of the byte. This
# must not have any whitespace preceeding it. Then, the byte's description.
# Lastly, an optional formula to convert the raw value. The formula can use "+",
# "-", "*", "/", or parentheses, and the variable "n" is used to represent the
# raw value (see the line for "COOLDEGA" for an example).
#
# If the individual bits have meanings, 8 extra lines can be added. Each of
# these lines must have a description, indented with whitespace. Optionally,
# two more strings may follow describing the meaning of a 0 and a 1 in that
# bit's position, otherwise "No" and "Yes" will be assumed. See the "NVMW" byte
# below for an example of bit descriptions.
#
# Occasionally, a couple bits together make up one value using a lookup table.
# For these bits, rather than putting a description, choose a table name.
# Following that, put the column number of the lookup table each bit corresponds
# to (starting with 0). Then, following all the regular data descriptions,
# place the lookup table. Instructions on doing that are with the lookup tables
# at the end of this file. See "IODPORTC" for an example.
#
# Finally, if two adjacent bytes have the same name except for the second having
# a "+1" suffix (For example, "PROMIDA" and "PROMIDA+1"), they will be treated
# as two bytes in a 16-bit value. The first byte will be most significant and
# the second will be least (big endian). The description and optional conversion
# formula will come from the first byte.
